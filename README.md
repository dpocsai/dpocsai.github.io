Early practice projects - a variety of simple games created at the beginning of my dev journey!

1) colorPick - a reaction time game where the user picks the correct color as quick as possible, with distractions to make things more tricky.

2) countUp - a reaction time game where the user must tap numbers, arranged in a grid, from lowest to highest.

3) findNum - a reaction time game where the user must locate a specified number within a grid, as fast as possible.

4) highLow - a math game where the user is given a simple addition statement (ex. 5 + 4), as well as a number (ex. 11) and must quickly determine if the number is lower, higher, or the same when compared to the simple addition statement.

5) mazeGame - a maze game created using SVG paths where the user must click and drag a ball through a maze without touching any of the walls.

6) memory - a memory game where the user must memorize a series of numbers in a grid, as quickly as possible. When they feel they have memorized the numbers, they click a button that hides all the numbers, and they are asked at random where one of those numbers was positioned.

7) tic-tac-toe - a classic version of tic-tac-toe, with the 'computer' acting as the opponent, using a certain strategy to make things more difficult.

8) blackjack - a classic version of blackjack, with the dealer acting as the opponent. 



Recent practice projects - games with some more complexity

1) wordle - Inspired by the viral NYT game, this "Wordle" remake includes three parts: 
  - A classic wordle style game, using the same word list as the original game, but allowing unlimited plays.
  - A wordle solver, using a custom-created algorithm for solving wordle games in an average of 3.6 guesses, where the user inputs their wordle guess, and the resulting tile colors; and the algorithm generates the best possible next guess to make.
  - Speed wordle - a fast-paced twist on the original game. Users have power-ups such as the ability to reveal letters, eliminate incorrect letters, and undo a previous guess, and they aim to solve as many 'wordles' as they can within a given time limit - getting bonus points for speed, and solving with as few guesses as possible.

2) buzzwords - Inspired by the NYT game "Spelling Bee", and mainly because of the paid subscription required to play it. Users must create as many words as they can from 6 outer letters, and 1 inner letter. The inner letter must always be used, and any letters may be repeated. More points are awarded for longer words.
